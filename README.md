# db-ticket
db-ticket is a little library to check whether a given PDF file is a valid online ticket issued by [Deutsche Bahn](http://bahn.de/).

Please note that this library can't read the actual information on the ticket.

## Languages and platforms

This library exists in two languages so far:
* C (standard C99), for any UNIX system,
* C#, for any .NET 4.0 (or higher) project,

The C library should also work for iOS, but as I have no resources for iOS development, I can't test that.

Documentation on API usage and sample code for all languages and platforms can be found in `Documentation.md`.

## Licence
The code is licenced under a MIT licence (see LICENSE.md for details).
